# giteahomeassesment

Take Home Test - Skill set 1, step 7
To automate the following:
-Provision a VM on the cloud (in this case, AWS)
-Set up an application load balancer that redirects HTTPS traffic to the gitea server.

Unfortunately I am a noob, so at the moment I am not able to automate step 2, which is:
-Install and run Gitea on that VM
Upon some searching online, it seems that Terraform is not a application deployment software.
